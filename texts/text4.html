      <h3 class="bolder">A Blasphemer</h3>
      <h4 class="subtitle">(Behind every blasphemer there's an enchanted garden)</h4>
      <p>
        I never again bent down, not even over a flower.<br>
        I blushed no more in stealing love<br>
        from the moment Winter convinced me that God<br>
        would not be blushed stealing mine from me.<br><br>

        They arrested me one day for the women and the wine.<br>
        They didn’t have laws to punish a blasphemer.<br>
        Death didn’t kill me, but two holier-than-thou guards<br>
        searched my soul with the force of blows.<br><br>

        Because I said that God deceived the first man.<br>
        He forced him to travel life as a fool.<br>
        In the enchanted garden He forced him to dream,<br>
        "to ignore that there's both good and evil in the world."<br><br>

        When He saw that the man stretched his fingers<br>
        to steal the mystery of a prohibited apple,<br>
        fearing that by then he had no masters<br>
        He stopped him with death, He invented the seasons.<br><br>

        They searched my soul with the force of blows<br><br>
        
        And if there were two guards to stop my life,<br>
        it is only here on earth the prohibited apple.<br>
        And not God, but someone who invented it for us.<br>
        forces us to dream in an enchanted garden,<br>
        forces us to dream in an enchanted garden,<br>
        forces us to dream in an enchanted garden.
