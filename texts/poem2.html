      Out of a <span class="secret">cell</span> into this darkened <span class="religion">space</span>--<br>
      The <span class="eternalsleep">end</span> at twenty-five!<br>
      My tongue could not speak what stirred within me,<br>
      And the <span class="nature">village</span> thought me a <span class="suffering">fool</span>.<br>
      Yet at the start there was a clear vision,<br>
      A high and urgent purpose in my <span class="salvation">soul</span><br>
      Which drove me on trying to <span class="memory">memorize</span><br>
      The <span class="writing">Encyclopedia Britannica</span>!
