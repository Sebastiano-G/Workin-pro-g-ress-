      <h3 class="bolder">A chemist</h3>
      <p>
        Only death brought me to the hill,<br>
        a body among so many to give phosphorus to the air,<br>
        for campfires they call ghost-lights<br>
        that leave no ashes nor dissolve the frost.<br>
        Only death has brought me to the hill.<br><br>

        As a chemist, at one time I had the power<br>
        to marry the elements and make them react.<br>
        But people I never managed to understand,<br>
        because they combined through love.<br>
        Entrusting joy and sorrow to a game.<br><br>

        Look at the smile, look at the color,<br>
        as they play on the face of one searching for love:<br>
        but the same smile, the same color,<br>
        where are they on the face of one who has love?<br>
        Where are they on the face of one who has love?<br><br>

        It’s strange to go away without suffering,<br>
        without the face of a woman one must remember.<br>
        But perhaps it’s different your dying,<br>
        you who go out into love, who surrender to April.<br>
        What’s different in your dying?<br><br>

        Spring doesn’t knock, it enters sure<br>
        like smoke, it penetrates every fissure.<br>
        It has lips of flesh and corn hair -<br>
        what fear, what desire that takes you by the hand.<br>
        What fear, what desire that carries you far away.<br><br>

        But look at hydrogen keeping quiet in the sea,<br>
        look at oxygen sleeping by its side:<br>
        only one law that I am able to understand<br>
        was able to marry them without making them explode.<br>
        Only one law that I am able to understand<br><br>

        I was a chemist, and no, I didn’t want to marry.<br>
        I didn’t know with whom, and whom I would have produced.<br>
        I am dead in an experiment gone wrong,<br>
        just like the idiots that die of love.<br>
        And someone will say there’s a better way.<br>
