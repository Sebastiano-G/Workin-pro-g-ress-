      <h3 class="bolder">A Judge</h3>
      <p>
        What does it mean to be <span class="family">five foot tall</span>,<br>
        it’s revealed in the <span class="sight">eyes</span> and the comments of people,<br>
        or the curiosity of an irreverent girl<br>
        who approaches only on account of her impertinent doubt:<br>
        she wants to discover whether it’s true what they say about <span class="family">dwarfs</span>,<br>
        that they’re better endowed with the least apparent virtue<br>
        which, of all the virtues, is the most indecent.<br><br>

        Years pass, as do months, and, if you count them, so do minutes,<br>
        it’s sad to find yourself an adult without having grown up;<br>
        backbiting insists, it beats its tongue on a drum<br>
        until it says that a <span class="family">dwarf</span> is certainly a skunk<br>
        because his <span class="salvation">heart</span> is too close to his arsehole.<br><br>

        It was in the sleepless nights watched over by the <span class="darknessvslight">light</span> of ill <span class="love">feeling</span><br>
        that I studied for my exams, I became an <span class="justice">attorney</span><br>
        to take the road that from the pews of a cathedral<br>
        led to the vestry then to the bench of a <span class="justice">court</span>,<br>
        a <span class="justice">judge</span> at last, the <span class="sight">arbiter</span> on earth of good and bad.<br><br>

        And so my <span class="family">height</span> no longer bestowed good humour<br>
        on he who, standing in the dock, called me “Your Honour”,<br>
        and entrusting him to the <span class="hate">executioner</span> was entirely my pleasure,<br>
        before genuflecting in the hour of farewell<br>
        not knowing at all the <span class="family">height</span> of <span class="church">God</span>.
