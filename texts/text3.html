      <h3 class="bolder">A Judge</h3>
      <p>
        What does it mean to be five foot tall,<br>
        it’s revealed in the eyes and the comments of people,<br>
        or the curiosity of an irreverent girl<br>
        who approaches only on account of her impertinent doubt:<br>
        she wants to discover whether it’s true what they say about dwarfs,<br>
        that they’re better endowed with the least apparent virtue<br>
        which, of all the virtues, is the most indecent.<br><br>

        Years pass, as do months, and, if you count them, so do minutes,<br>
        it’s sad to find yourself an adult without having grown up;<br>
        backbiting insists, it beats its tongue on a drum<br>
        until it says that a dwarf is certainly a skunk<br>
        because his heart is too close to his arsehole.<br><br>

        It was in the sleepless nights watched over by the light of ill feeling<br>
        that I studied for my exams, I became an attorney<br>
        to take the road that from the pews of a cathedral<br>
        led to the vestry then to the bench of a court,<br>
        a judge at last, the arbiter on earth of good and bad.<br><br>

        And so my height no longer bestowed good humour<br>
        on he who, standing in the dock, called me “Your Honour”,<br>
        and entrusting him to the executioner was entirely my pleasure,<br>
        before genuflecting in the hour of farewell<br>
        not knowing at all the height of God.
