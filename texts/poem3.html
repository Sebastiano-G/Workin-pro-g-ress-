      <p>
        Suppose you just stood <span class="family">five feet</span> two,<br>
        And had worked your way as a grocery clerk,<br>
        Studying <span class="justice">law</span> by candle <span class="darknessvslight">light</span><br>
        Until you became an <span class="justice">attorney</span> at <span class="justice">law</span>?<br>
        And then suppose through your <span class="knowledge">diligence</span><br>
        And regular church attendance,<br>
        You became <span class="justice">attorney</span> for Thomas Rhodes,<br>
        Collecting notes and mortgages,<br>
        And representing all the widows<br>
        In the <span class="justice">Probate</span> <span class="justice">Court</span>? And through it all<br>
        They jeered at your size, and laughed at your clothes<br>
        And your polished boots? And then suppose<br>
        You became the County <span class="justice">Judge</span>?<br>
        And Jefferson Howard and Kinsey Keene,<br>
        And Harmon Whitney, and all the giants<br>
        Who had sneered at you, were forced to stand<br>
        Before the bar and say "Your Honor"--<br>
        Well, don't you think it was natural<br>
        That I made it hard for them?<br>
