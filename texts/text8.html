      <h3 class="bolder">Un ottico</h3>
      <p>
        Colour-blind long-sighted, beggars of sight<br>
        the merchant of light, your optician,<br>
        now only wants special clients<br>
        who don’t know what to do with normal eyes.<br><br>
        No longer an optician, but a lens dealer<br>
        for improvising happy eyes,<br>
        because the pupils who are used to copying<br>
        invent worlds on which they can watch.<br>
        Follow with me these dreaming eyes,<br>
        fleeing from the orbit and not wanting to return.<br><br>
        “I see that I climb to steal the sun<br>
        so as to have no more nights,<br>
        I closed it in my eyes<br>
        so as not to let it fall in nets of sunsets,<br>
        and who will be cold will be cold<br>
        along my glance they’ll need to warm up.”<br><br>
        “I see the rivers inside my veins,<br>
        they seek, they seek,<br>
        they seek, they seek,<br>
        they seek their sea,<br>
        they break the banks, the banks,<br>
        the banks, the banks,<br>
        they find skies, skies, skies,<br>
        skies to photograph.<br>
        Blood that runs without imagination<br>
        brings tumours of melancholy.”<br><br>
        “I see gendarmes graze<br>
        women bent over the dew,<br>
        red the tongues from the pollen of flowers<br>
        but where’s the queen bee?<br>
        Maybe she’s flown to dawn’s nests,<br>
        maybe she’s flown, maybe she no longer flies.”<br><br>
        “I see friends still on the road,<br>
        they aren’t in a hurry,<br>
        they still steal happiness from sleep<br>
        and a bit of night from dawn,<br>
        and then the light, light that transforms<br>
        the world into a toy.”<br><br>
