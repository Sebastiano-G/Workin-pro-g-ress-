      <p>
        I said when they handed me my diploma,<br>
        I said to myself I will be good<br>
        And wise and brave and helpful to others;<br>
        I said I will carry the Christian creed<br>
        Into the practice of medicine!<br>
        Somehow the world and the other doctors<br>
        Know what's in your heart as soon as you make<br>
        This high-souled resolution.<br>
        And the way of it is they starve you out.<br>
        And no one comes to you but the poor.<br>
        And you find too late that being a doctor<br>
        Is just a way of making a living.<br>
        And when you are poor and have to carry<br>
        The Christian creed and wife and children<br>
        All on your back, it is too much.<br>
        That's why I made the Elixir of Youth,<br>
        Which landed me in the jail at Peoria,<br>
        Branded a swindler and a crook<br>
        By the upright federal judge!<br>
