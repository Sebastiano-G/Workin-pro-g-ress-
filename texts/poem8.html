        What do you see now?<br>
        Globes of red, yellow, purple.<br>
        Just a moment! And now?<br>
        My father and mother and sisters.<br>
        Yes! And now?<br>
        Knights at arms, beautiful women, kind faces.<br>
        Try this.<br>
        A field of grain -- a city.<br>
        Very good! And Now?<br>
        A young woman with angels bending over her.<br>
        A heavier lens! And Now?<br>
        Many women with bright eyes and open lips.<br>
        Try this.<br>
        Just a goblet on a table.<br>
        Oh I see! Try this lens!<br>
        Just an open space -- I see nothing in particular.<br>
        Well, now!<br>
        Pine trees, a lake, summer sky.<br>
        That's better. And now?<br>
        A book.<br>
        Read a page for me.<br>
        I can't. My eyes are carried beyond the page.<br>
        Try this lens.<br>
        Depths of air.<br>
        Excellent! and now?<br>
        Light, just light, making everything below a toy world.<br>
        Very well, we'll make the glasses accordingly.<br>
