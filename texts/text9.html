      <p>
        In a whirlpool of dust<br>
        the others saw drought<br>
        it reminded me<br>
        of Jennyâ€™s skirt<br>
        in a dance many years ago.<br><br>

        I felt my earth<br>
        vibrate with sounds, it was my heart,<br>
        and so why till it again<br>
        how to think it better.<br><br>

        Liberty I have seen it sleeping<br>
        in the tilled fields<br>
        from heaven and money,<br>
        from heaven and love,<br>
        protected by barbed wire.<br><br>

        Liberty I have seen it wake up<br>
        every time I have played<br>
        for a rustle of girls<br>
        at a dance<br>
        for a drunk companion.<br><br>

        And then if people know<br>
        and people know you can play,<br>
        playing is up to you<br>
        all life long<br>
        and you like being listened to.<br><br>
        
        It ended up with fields of weeds<br>
        it ended up with a broken flute<br>
        and many memories<br>
        and a raucous laughter<br>
        and not even one regret.<br>
