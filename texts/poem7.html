      <p>
        Only the chemist can tell, and not always the chemist,<br>
        What will result from compounding<br>
        Fluids or solids.<br>
        And who can tell<br>
        How men and women will interact<br>
        On each other, or what children will result?<br>
        There were Benjamin Pantier and his wife,<br>
        Good in themselves, but evil toward each other;<br>
        He oxygen, she hydrogen,<br>
        Their son, a devastating fire.<br>
        I Trainor, the druggist, a miser of chemicals,<br>
        Killed while making an experiment,<br>
        Lived unwedded.<br>
