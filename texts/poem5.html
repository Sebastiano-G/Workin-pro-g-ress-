      <p>
        I could not run or play in boyhood.<br>
        In manhood I could only sip the cup,<br>
        Not drink-<br>
        For scarlet-fever left my heart diseased.<br>
        Yet I lie here<br>
        Soothed by a secret none but Mary knows:<br>
        There is a garden of acacia,<br>
        Catalpa trees, and arbors sweet with vines--<br>
        There on that afternoon in June<br>
        By Mary's side--<br>
        Kissing her with my soul upon my lips<br>
        It suddenly took flight.<br>
