        Where’d Elmer go,<br>
        who left himself to <span class="death">die</span> of <span class="sickness">fever</span>?<br>
        Where’s Herman, burned in a mine?<br><br>
        Where are Bert and Tom,<br>
        the first one killed in a brawl<br>
        and the other who got out of jail <span class="death">dead</span> already?<br><br>
        And what of Charley,<br>
        who fell while working?<br>
        From a bridge he flew, flew onto the road.<br><br>
        
        They’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>,<br>
        they’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>
        
        Where are Ella and Kate,<br>
        both <span class="death">dead</span> by mistake,<br>
        one from an abortion, the other of love?<br><br>
        And Maggie, killed in a brothel<br>
        by the <span class="love">caresses</span> of a brute?<br>
        And Edith consumed by a strange <span class="sickness">illness</span>?<br><br>
        And Lizzie who pursued <span class="salvation">life</span><br>
        far away, and from England<br>
        was carried back to this palm of earth?<br><br>
        
        They’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>,<br>
        they’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>
        
        Where are the generals,<br>
        who decorate themselves in the battles<br>
        with <span class="death">cemeteries</span> of crosses on their chests?<br><br>
        Where the sons of the war,<br>
        departed for an ideal,<br>
        for a fraud, for a love that ended poorly?<br><br>
        They sent <span class="family">home </span><br>
        their <span class="death">remains</span> in the barriers,<br>
        bound tight so they seemed of one piece.<br><br>
        
        They’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the hill,<br>
        they’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>
        
        Where is Jones the <span class="music">player</span>,<br>
        who was surprised by his ninety years<br>
        and would still have <span class="music ">played</span> with <span class="salvation">life</span>?<br><br>
        He who offered his face to the wind,<br>
        his throat to the wine, and never a thought<br>
        to money, to love, nor to <span class="salvation">heaven</span>.<br><br>
        Yes, it seems one can hear him<br>
        still prattling on about the crap<br>
        eaten on the streets in the wrong hours.<br><br>
        It seems you can still hear him<br>
        saying to the liquor merchant,<br>  
        “You who sell it, what do you buy for yourself that’s better?”<br><br>
