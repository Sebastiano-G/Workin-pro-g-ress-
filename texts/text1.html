      <h3 class="bolder">The Hill</h3>
      <p>
        Where are Elmer, Herman, Bert, Tom and Charley, The weak of will, the strong of arm, the clown, the boozer, the fighter? All, all are sleeping on the hill. One passed in a fever, One was burned in a mine, One was killed in a brawl, One died in jail, One fell from a bridge toiling for children and wife -- All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. Where are Ella, Kate, Mag, Lizzie and Edith, The tender heart, the simple soul, the loud, the proud, the happy one? -- All, all are sleeping on the hill. One died in shameful child-birth, One of a thwarted love, One at the hands of a brute in a brothel, One of broken pride, in the search for heart's desire, One after life in far-away London and Paris Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag -- All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily, And old Towny Kinkaid and Sevigne Houghton, And Major Walker who had talked With venerable men of the revolution?-- All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. They brought them dead sons from the war, And daughters whom life had crushed, And their children fatherless, crying-- All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. Where is Old Fiddler Jones Who played with life all his ninety years, Braving the sleet with bared breast, Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin, Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven? Lo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago, Of the horse-races of long ago at Clary's Grove, Of what Abe Lincoln said One time in Springfield.Where’d Elmer go,<br>
        "who left himself to die of fever?<br>
        Where’s Herman, burned in a mine?<br>
        Where are Bert and Tom,<br>
        the first one killed in a brawl<br>
        and the other who got out of jail dead already?<br>
        And what of Charley,<br>
        who fell while working?<br>
        From a bridge he flew, flew onto the road.<br><br>
        
        They’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the hill,<br>
        they’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the hill.<br><br>
        
        Where are Ella and Kate,<br>
        both dead by mistake,<br>
        one from an abortion, the other of love?<br>
        And Maggie, killed in a brothel<br>
        by the caresses of a brute?<br>
        And Edith consumed by a strange illness?<br>
        And Lizzie who pursued life<br>
        far away, and from England<br>
        was carried back to this palm of earth?<br><br>
        
        They’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the hill,<br>
        they’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the hill.<br><br>
        
        Where are the generals,<br>
        who decorate themselves in the battles<br>
        with cemeteries of crosses on their chests?<br>
        Where the sons of the war,<br>
        departed for an ideal,<br>
        for a fraud, for a love that ended poorly?<br>
        They sent home<br>
        their remains in the barriers,<br>
        bound tight so they seemed of one piece.<br><br>
        
        They’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the hill,<br>
        they’re sleeping, they’re sleeping on the hill.<br><br>
        
        Where is Jones the player,<br>
        who was surprised by his ninety years<br>
        and would still have played with life?<br>
        He who offered his face to the wind,<br>
        his throat to the wine, and never a thought<br>
        to money, to love, nor to heaven.<br>
        Yes, it seems one can hear him<br>
        still prattling on about the crap<br>
        eaten on the streets in the wrong hours.<br>
        It seems you can still hear him<br>
        saying to the liquor merchant,<br>
        “You who sell it, what do you buy for yourself that’s better?”<br><br>
