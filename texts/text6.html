      <h3 class="bolder">A doctor</h3>
      <p>
        As a child I wanted to heal cherry trees<br>
        when, red with fruit, I believed them injured.<br>
        For me, health had left them<br>
        with the snowy flowers they’d lost.<br><br>

        A dream, it was a dream, but it wasn't short-lived.<br>
        For this I swore that I would become a doctor,<br>
        and not for a god, nor either for play:<br>
        so that the cherry trees would return in bloom,<br>
        so that the cherry trees would return in bloom.<br><br>

        And when I was a doctor finally,<br>
        I didn’t want to betray the child for the man,<br>
        and so many came and they called themselves “people,<br>
        sick cherry trees in every season.<br><br>

        And my colleagues in agreement, contented colleagues,<br>
        reading in my heart so much desire to love,<br>
        sent me their best clients,<br>
        with the diagnosis on their faces -<br>
        and for everyone it was the same:<br>
        sick with hunger, unable to pay.<br><br>

        And then I realized I had to understand<br>
        that being a doctor is just a job,<br>
        that you can’t give the science to people<br>
        if you don’t want to fall sick with the identical ailment,<br>
        if you don’t want the system to starve you into submission.<br><br>

        And the reliable system is to starve you into submission,<br>
        in your children, in your wife, who now despise you.<br>
        Therefore I sealed in a bottle those snowy flowers.<br>
        The label said: elixir of youth.<br><br>

        And a judge, a judge with the face of a man,<br>
        sent me off to leaf through sunsets in prison,<br>
        useless to the world and to my fingers,<br>
        branded forever a swindler, a crook,<br>
        doctor, professor, swindler, crook.
