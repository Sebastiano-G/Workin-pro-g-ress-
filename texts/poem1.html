      <h3 class="bolder">The Hill</h3>
      <p>
        Where are Elmer, Herman, Bert, Tom and Charley,<br>
        The weak of will, the strong of arm, the clown, the boozer, the fighter?<br>
        All, all are sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br>
        One passed in a <span class="sickness">fever</span>,<br>
        One was burned in a mine,<br>
        One was killed in a brawl,<br>
        One <span class="death">died</span> in jail,<br>
        One fell from a bridge toiling for <span class="family">children</span> and <span class="family">wife</span> --<br>
        All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>

        Where are Ella, Kate, Mag, Lizzie and Edith,<br>
        The tender <span class="salvation">heart</span>, the simple <span class="salvation">soul</span>, the loud, the proud, the happy one? --<br>
        All, all are sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>

        One <span class="death">died</span> in shameful child-birth,<br>
        One of a thwarted love,<br>
        One at the hands of a brute in a brothel,<br>
        One of broken pride, in the search for <span class="salvation">heart</span>'s desire,<br>
        One after <span class="salvation">life</span> in far-away London and Paris<br>
        Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag --<br>
        All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>

        Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily,<br>
        And old Towny Kinkaid and Sevigne Houghton,<br>
        And Major Walker who had talked<br>
        With venerable men of the revolution?--<br>
        All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>

        They brought them <span class="death">dead</span> sons from the war,<br>
        And daughters whom <span class="salvation">life</span> had crushed,<br>
        And their <span class="family">children</span> fatherless, crying--<br>
        All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the <span class="nature">hill</span>.<br><br>

        Where is Old <span class="music">Fiddler</span> Jones<br>
        Who <span class="music">played</span> with <span class="salvation">life</span> all his ninety years,<br>
        Braving the sleet with bared breast,<br>
        Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of <span class="family">wife</span> nor kin,<br>
        Nor gold, nor love, nor <span class="salvation">heaven</span>?<br>
        Lo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago,<br>
        Of the horse-races of long ago at Clary's <span class="nature">Grove</span>,<br>
        Of what Abe Lincoln said<br>
        One time in Springfield.<br>
