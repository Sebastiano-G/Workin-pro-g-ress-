      <h3 class="bolder">A Madman</h3>
      <h4 class="subtitle">(Behind every fool there’s a village)</h4>
      <p>
        You try to have a world in your heart<br>
        and can’t manage to express it with words,<br>
        and the light of day separates the plaza<br>
        into a laughing village and you, the fool, who passes.<br>
        And not even the night leaves you alone:<br>
        the others dream of themselves and you dream of them.<br><br>

        And yes, even you would go to search<br>
        for the words certain to make them listen to you:<br>
        to amaze for a half hour, a book of history is enough.<br>
        I tried to learn the Encyclopedia Treccani by heart,<br>
        and after 'pig,' 'Majakowsky,' 'messy,'<br>
        the others continued on until they read me 'crazy.'<br>
        And without knowing to whom I owed my life,<br>
        to a madhouse I returned it:<br>
        here on the hill I sleep unwillingly.<br>
        yet by now there is light in my thoughts.<br>
        Here in the semi-darkness, now I invent words,<br>
        though I miss a light, the light of the sun.<br><br>

        My bones are still giving to life:<br>
        they’re still giving it flowery grass.<br>
        But life remained in the voices on the sly<br>
        of those who lost the fool and mourn for him in the hill,<br>
        of those who still whisper with the same irony,<br>
        “A merciful death tore him out of craziness.”<br>
