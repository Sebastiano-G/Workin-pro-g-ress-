        They first charged me with disorderly conduct,<br>
        There being no statute on blasphemy.<br>
        Later they locked me up as insane<br>
        Where I was beaten to death by a Catholic guard.<br>
        My offense was this:<br>
        I said God lied to Adam, and destined him<br>
        To lead the life of a fool,<br>
        Ignorant that there is evil in the world as well as good.<br>
        And when Adam outwitted God by eating the apple<br>
        And saw through the lie,<br>
        God drove him out of Eden to keep him from taking<br>
        The fruit of immortal life.<br>
        For Christ’s sake, you sensible people,<br>
        Here’s what God Himself said about it in the book of Genesis:<br>
        “And the Lord God said, behold the man<br>
        is become one of us” (a little envy, you see),<br>
        “To know good and evil” (the all-is-good lie exposed)<br>
        “And now lest he put forth his hand and take<br>
        Also of the three of life and eat, and live forever:<br>
        Therefore the Lord God sent Him forth from the garden of Eden<br>
        (The reason I believe God crucified His Own Son<br>
        To get out of the wretched tangle is, because it sounds just like Him).<br>
